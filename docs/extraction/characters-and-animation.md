## 1. Scope and module map

The character subsystem turns EFT's one shared biped, a character's skinned part prefabs, and its Mecanim animation set into a `.eftchar` pack. The pack is self-describing: `manifest.json` declares every stride, byte offset, count and convention, and the consumer reads the layout from the manifest rather than hardcoding it.

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `extraction/characters/coords.py` | the `G3` conjugation and the UV flip, and nothing else |
| `extraction/characters/unity_bind.py` | transform-path CRC-32, curve-index ↔ binding walk, digest self-check |
| `extraction/characters/skeleton.py` | `skeleton.bundle` → canonical bone table |
| `extraction/characters/skin.py` | part bundle → meshes, bone remap, inverse bindposes, materials, textures, rigid attachments |
| `extraction/characters/clips.py` | `AnimationClip` → resampled per-bone tracks |
| `extraction/characters/controller.py` | `AnimatorController` + `PlayerStateContainer` → state table |
| `extraction/characters/validate.py` | anatomical validation of composed poses |
| `extraction/characters/pack.py` | writes `manifest.json` + `skin.bin` + `anim.bin` + `textures/` |
| `extraction/characters/appearance.py` | rolls WHICH prefabs a bot wears, from the game's own weighted tables |
| `extraction/characters/build_character.py` | CLI and ordering |
| `extraction/characters/unity_deps.py` | CAB → bundle index for cross-bundle PPtr resolution |
| `viewer/src/character/pack.rs` | `.eftchar` loader (Rust) |
| `viewer/src/character/rig.rs` | pack → entity hierarchy + skinned draws |
| `viewer/src/character/anim.rs` | clip sampling, blend-tree evaluation, pose accumulation |
| `viewer/src/character/drive.rs`, `viewer/src/npc.rs` | parameter synthesis and state selection |

Build ordering is load-bearing (`extraction/characters/build_character.py:12-15`): skeleton first because every later join keys off its path strings; controller before clips because the controller's `m_TOS` self-validates the path digest in one second instead of after thousands of unbound tracks.

---

## 2. Locating the rig, the parts and the clips in the bundles

Everything lives under `<game>/EscapeFromTarkov_Data/StreamingAssets/Windows/`. The character root is `assets/content/characters/`.

- **Rig**: `character/skeleton.bundle`. One `Transform` hierarchy, exactly one root. Every character in the game binds this rig (`extraction/characters/skeleton.py:3`).
- **Body parts**: `character/prefabs/<part>.bundle`, e.g. `top_boss_tagilla.bundle`. Each is a `SkinnedMeshRenderer` + `LODGroup` with a `Skin` MonoBehaviour carrying `_bonePaths`.
- **Controllers**: `controllers/animationcontrollers/<stem>botanimcontroller.bundle` and `controllers/player_anim_controller.bundle`. `extraction/characters/appearance.py:15-16` names the stems `base`, `boar`, `tagilla`; `controller_for` discovers stems by directory listing at runtime, so the shipped set is unverified.
- **Shared clips**: `animations/character_animations.bundle`.
- **Root-motion tables**: `rootmotiontable/<stem>botrootmotiontable.bundle` (read as a bundle path in the registry; the extractor does not currently parse it).

Two bundle-loading rules that must be respected or half the data silently reads as empty:

1. **The controller and the shared animation bundles must be loaded into ONE `UnityPy` environment** (`extraction/characters/build_character.py:121-131`). `m_AnimationClips` entries with non-zero `m_FileID` are external PPtrs; UnityPy can only follow those into a file it already holds. Measured on `TagillaBotAnimController`: 847 declared clip slots. How those split between the controller's own bundle and external ones (430 in its own bundle, per the `_animationsComment` in `extraction/characters/characters.json`) is unverified. A missing dependency does not error, it yields an empty clip name.
2. **A bundle is recognised by its header, never its filename.** `extraction/characters/unity_deps.py:35` accepts `UnityFS`, `UnityWeb`, `UnityRaw`, `UnityArchive`. The counts recorded at `unity_deps.py:14-17` - 1,160 bundles shipping with no extension at all, and 2,295 CABs missed by an index that globbed `*.bundle` - are unverified without a game install.

Cross-bundle dependency resolution for equipment prefabs goes through a CAB→bundle map (`extraction/characters/unity_deps.py:118`): the container's `AssetBundle.m_Dependencies` lists CAB names, the index maps each to a file, and those files are loaded into the same environment. Only the objects the container itself introduced are baked - dependency bundles carry unrelated assets.

**Who a character IS is derived, not authored.** `extraction/characters/appearance.py:111` rolls the bot type's weighted `appearance` table (slots `body`, `feet`, `hands`, `head`) with `random.Random(f"appearance:{bot_type}:{seed}")`, resolves each id through `customization.json` to a prefab path, and returns a build spec. `hands` resolves to the first-person prefabs and is tagged `view: "first"`; the other three are `"third"` (`extraction/characters/appearance.py:48`).

---

## 3. Coordinate frame, units, and the handedness rule

Unity world → viewer world is a single reflection, identical to the map pipeline's:

```
G3 = diag(-1, 1, 1)        det(G3) = -1        G3⁻¹ = G3
```

Units are metres, up axis is +Y, quaternions are stored **xyzw**. All binary data is **little-endian** (`struct` format strings use `<`; numpy `tobytes()` on x86; the Rust loader uses `f32::from_le_bytes` / `u32::from_le_bytes` / `u16::from_le_bytes`).

Per-datum rules, all in `extraction/characters/coords.py`:

| datum | transform | anchor |
|---|---|---|
| point / position key | `(x,y,z) → (-x, y, z)` | `coords.py:34` |
| normal | same as point (`(G⁻¹)ᵀ = G` for diagonal `G`), stays unit | `coords.py:46` |
| tangent `(x,y,z,w)` | `(-x, y, z, -w)` - the handedness sign flips | `coords.py:51` |
| rotation `(x,y,z,w)` | `(x, -y, -z, w)` | `coords.py:74` |
| scale | unchanged (diagonal ∘ diagonal) | `coords.py:18` |
| 4×4 affine (inverse bindpose) | `M' = G M G⁻¹` | `coords.py:87` |
| triangle winding | `(a,b,c) → (a,c,b)` | `coords.py:97` |
| UV | `v → 1 − v` (Unity origin bottom-left) | `coords.py:60` |

The quaternion rule is the pseudovector rule, not a typo. A rotation conjugated by a reflection is still a rotation (`det(GRG⁻¹) = det(R) = 1`), but the rotation axis is an axial vector so it picks up `det(G)`: `a → det(G)·(G a) = −(G a)`, which for `diag(-1,1,1)` is `(x, −y, −z)`; the angle is unchanged, hence `w` is untouched.

**The conjugation is applied once, per datum, and it telescopes through the hierarchy.** Each bone's LOCAL matrix is conjugated independently. Because `(G L₁ G⁻¹)(G L₂ G⁻¹)…(G Lₙ G⁻¹) = G (L₁L₂…Lₙ) G⁻¹`, composing conjugated locals gives exactly the conjugated world matrix. There is no separate "apply handedness to the whole rig" step, and adding one double-conjugates back to Unity space.

Skinning survives the same way. With `p' = G p`, `W' = G W G⁻¹`, `B' = G B G⁻¹`: `W' B' p' = G W G⁻¹ · G B G⁻¹ · G p = G (W B p)`.

**Matrix convention is COLUMN-vector**, in the character pipeline and the map pipeline alike. `extraction/characters/skeleton.py:82` builds `M` with the rotation in `M[:3,:3]`, per-axis scale multiplied into the COLUMNS (`r * s[None, :]`), and translation in `M[:3, 3]`; composition is `parent @ local` (`skeleton.py:67`). A point transforms as `p' = M p`. Inverse bindposes are flattened **row-major** into the manifest (element order `m00 m01 m02 m03 m10 …`; measured: elements 12..15 of every emitted row are `0,0,0,1`). The only difference on the map side is storage packing, not math: `viewer/src/eftpack.rs:539-550` reconstructs an instance affine from a 3×4 row-major block as `Mat3::from_cols(Vec3::new(a[0],a[4],a[8]), Vec3::new(a[1],a[5],a[9]), Vec3::new(a[2],a[6],a[10]))` with translation `(a[3],a[7],a[11])` - the same column-vector matrix, stored 3×4 instead of 4×4.

The character path draws through the ordinary PBR pipeline with back-face culling ON, so the mirror is absorbed by **reversing the index buffer**. The map's `gpu_driven` path instead draws double-sided with a cofactor normal matrix. Both are correct; do not mix them on one asset.

---

## 4. The skeleton

`extraction/characters/skeleton.py:107` reads every `Transform` and `GameObject` typetree in `skeleton.bundle`. A bone's name is its owning GameObject's `m_Name`.

- **Root**: the single transform whose `m_Father.m_PathID == 0`. More or fewer than one is a hard error (`skeleton.py:132`).
- **Order**: depth-first from the root, children in `m_Children` order. This is stable across runs and guarantees `parents[i] < i`, so a consumer computes world matrices in one forward pass with no sort (`skeleton.py:191`, re-asserted in `viewer/src/character/pack.rs:506`).
- **Paths** are relative to the rig ROOT and exclude it: the root's own path is `""`, its first child's path is just that child's name (`skeleton.py:144-153`). This matters because `Skin._bonePaths` and Mecanim clip bindings are both relative to the GameObject carrying the Animator, and because Unity denotes "my root transform" with `CRC32("") == 0`.
- **Per-bone data**: `m_LocalPosition` through `coords.point`, `m_LocalRotation` (xyzw) through `coords.quat`, `m_LocalScale` verbatim. Stored as `float32` arrays of shape `(N,3)`, `(N,4)`, `(N,3)`.

Build-time assertions: every transform must be reached by the walk (`skeleton.py:183`); bone names must be unique (`skeleton.py:188`); `parents[i] < i` (`skeleton.py:192`); path hashes must not collide (`skeleton.py:197` → `unity_bind.build_hash_map`).

**Measured rig (Tagilla and player packs, EFT live build): 79 bones.** Index 0 `Skeleton` (root, parent −1, path `""`), 1 `Root_Joint`, 2 `Base HumanPelvis`, 24 `Base HumanHead`, 68 `Weapon_root`, 78 `Camera_animated_3rd`.

Indices 3..67 hold the biped chains (`Base HumanL/RThigh1/2`, `Calf`, `Foot`, `Toe`, `Spine1..3`, `Neck`, `Head`, `Ribcage`, `L/RCollarbone`, `Upperarm`, `Forearm1..3`, `Palm`, `Digit11..53`) plus SIX gear nodes - `Base HumanGear1` 14, `Gear2` 15, `Gear3` 16, `Gear4` 17, `Gear4_1` 18, `Gear5` 19 - and `Base HumanBackpack` 22, and nothing else. Every rig extra sits ABOVE `Weapon_root`: `Bend_Goal_Left` 69, `Bend_Goal_Right` 70, `IK_S_LPalm` 71, `IK_S_RPalm` 72, `LCollarbone_anim` 73, `RCollarbone_anim` 74, `weapon_holster` 75, `weapon_holster1` 76, `Weapon_root_3rd_anim` 77, `Camera_animated_3rd` 78.

Measured on the Tagilla pack, maximum path depth is **15 segments** and the digit chains occupy depths 13–15. The longest path is:

```
Root_Joint/Base HumanPelvis/Base HumanSpine1/Base HumanSpine2/Base HumanSpine3/Base HumanRibcage/Base HumanLCollarbone/Base HumanLUpperarm/Base HumanLForearm1/Base HumanLForearm2/Base HumanLForearm3/Base HumanLPalm/Base HumanLDigit11/Base HumanLDigit12/Base HumanLDigit13
```

The suffix index at `skin.py:171` is sized from a rough per-path segment estimate, not from this depth figure.

`Skeleton.by_hash` (`skeleton.py:54`) is `{CRC32(path): index}` and is THE join key for clip bindings.

---

## 5. Skinning: bone remap, weights, bindposes

`extraction/characters/skin.py:346` reads one part bundle. Geometry comes out of `UnityPy.helpers.MeshHelper.MeshHandler` after `process()`.

### 5.1 Mesh-bone slot → rig bone

A part binds only the bones it needs (measured on Tagilla: the top binds 48 of 79, the pants 12). Two independent sources describe the mapping and both are read (`skin.py:210`):

- `Skin._bonePaths[i]` - path strings, per renderer component.
- `Mesh.m_BoneNameHashes[i]` - `CRC32(path)`, parallel to `Mesh.m_BindPose`.

Resolution order for a path: exact match against `Skeleton.paths`, then unique **root-relative suffix**. First-person hand prefabs root their paths one level down (`Base HumanPelvis/…` where the canonical rig says `Root_Joint/Base HumanPelvis/…`); `Wild_Body_1_firstHands` binds exactly 40 bones in the built `player_0`, `pmcusec_0` and `bosskilla_0` packs, and the stronger claim that all 40 of its paths are exact suffixes of canonical paths is unverified without the hands bundle. A suffix matching two different bones is a hard error, never a silent pick (`skin.py:236`, marker constant `AMBIGUOUS = -1` at `skin.py:162`). Hashes get the same treatment through a suffix-hash index (`skin.py:189`).

If NONE of the paths resolve, the mesh binds a genuinely different skeleton and is SKIPPED (`ForeignRigError`, `skin.py:205`). If some resolve and some do not, that is corruption and the build fails.

**When the two sources disagree, the mesh's own `m_BoneNameHashes` wins** (`skin.py:280-299`). The vertex bone indices address the mesh's bind-pose array, which is parallel to the hash list, so the hashes are authoritative by construction. Disagreements in shipped assets take both forms: `usec_upper_commando` is the same length but shifted two slots; `Top_BOSS_Killa_base` is a different length outright (49 vs 48), which is why a naive `zip()` diff reported nothing. The built packs are consistent with those figures (`Tshirt_usec_Commando` binds 49 bones, `Top_BOSS_Killa_base_lod0` binds 48), but the `_bonePaths`-versus-hash delta itself is unverified without the source bundles.

### 5.2 Influences and weights

Fixed **4 influences per vertex**. `handler.m_BoneIndices` and `handler.m_BoneWeights` are reshaped to `(V, ·)` and truncated to the first 4 columns (`skin.py:472-473`).

```
global_joints = remap[clip(local_joints, 0, n_slots-1)]      # local slot -> rig index
global_joints = where(weight > 0, global_joints, 0)          # zero-weight influence -> root
wsum          = weights.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
weights       = weights / wsum   where wsum > 1e-8           # partition of unity
weights[wsum <= 1e-8, 0] = 1.0                               # degenerate -> pinned to bone 0
```

(`skin.py:491-504`.) Any vertex referencing a slot ≥ `len(remap)` is a hard error (`skin.py:486`). Joint indices are stored as `u16`, so the rig may not exceed 65,536 bones.

### 5.3 Inverse bindposes

`Mesh.m_BindPose` is a list of `Matrix4x4f` typetrees with fields `e{row}{col}`, read into a 4×4 with translation in column 3 (`skin.py:131`). The count must equal the number of bound slots or the part is rejected (`skin.py:508`).

Each mesh gets a **rig-sized** table: `(boneCount, 4, 4) float32`, identity everywhere the mesh does not bind, and `coords.matrix4(B_slot)` at `remap[slot]` (`skin.py:512-514`). Cost is ~5 KB per mesh (79 × 64 bytes). The payoff is that every mesh of every part shares ONE joint list in the consumer, so assembling a character is "spawn the rig once, attach N meshes" with no per-part bone mapping at runtime.

### 5.4 Submeshes and indices

`Mesh.m_IndexFormat == 0` means 16-bit indices, anything else 32-bit; the per-submesh `firstByte` is divided by that size to get an index offset (`skin.py:534`). Per submesh:

```
seg = all_indices[firstByte/index_size : firstByte/index_size + indexCount] + baseVertex
seg = flip_winding(seg)                # (a,b,c) -> (a,c,b)
```

Submesh ranges are concatenated in order and recorded as `(material, indexStart, indexCount)` relative to the mesh's own index block.

**LOD** is parsed from the mesh name with `re.compile(r"_lod(\d+)")` searched ANYWHERE in the lowered name, not anchored at the end (`skin.py:140`): character parts are `Top_..._lod0` but equipment is `item_..._lod1_base`, and a suffix-only match let every equipment LOD through and drew the item twice.

---

## 6. Materials and textures

Materials come from `Material.m_SavedProperties` (`skin.py:390-421`). `m_TexEnvs` entries are `(slotName, {m_Texture: PPtr, …})`; the texture's `m_Name` becomes `textures/<name>.png` and the slot name is kept verbatim as the shader names it (`skin.py:393-409`). Measured across the built `tagilla`, `player_0`, `pmcusec_0` and `bosskilla_0` packs, the only slots emitted are `_MainTex`, `_BumpMap`, `_SpecMap`, and `_SpecTex` - the last appearing only on `item_equipment_facecover_welding_glass`. `_MarkTex`, `_EnvTex` and `_Cube` belong to the weapon and kit pipelines (`viewer/src/character/weapon.rs:218-228`, `out/weapons/*`, `out/kits/_parts/*`) and appear in no `.eftchar` pack. `m_Floats` and `m_Colors` are carried through raw. Pack-wide material indices are assigned with a `material_base` offset per part so submesh references stay global.

**Normal maps are repacked at write time** (`extraction/characters/pack.py:266`). Unity ships DXT5nm / BC5: X in ALPHA, Y in green, red pinned to ~1.0, Z reconstructed. The repack triggers on measurement, not filename - `if r.std() > 0.02: return img` passes an already-standard map through unchanged. Otherwise:

```
x = a*2 - 1;  y = g*2 - 1;  z = sqrt(clamp(1 - x² - y², 0, 1))
out = ((x,y,z) + 1) * 0.5
```

The filename check that selects candidates is `name.lower().endswith(("_n", "_normal", "_nrm"))` (`pack.py:89`).

`_SpecMap` is emitted but deliberately NOT bound by the consumer (`viewer/src/character/rig.rs:174-187`): it is a GLOSS map (high = shiny), the inverse of a roughness map, and binding it to occlusion crushed character ambient to a fifth with hard seams. It needs a `1 − x` pass at extraction before it is usable.

---

## 7. Animation clips: Unity curve decode

EFT's character clips are **generic**, not humanoid: bindings are `typeID 4` (Transform) with attribute 1/2/3/4. There is no muscle-space retargeting to undo.

### 7.1 Bindings and the curve index space

`m_ClipBindingConstant.genericBindings[]` entries carry `path` (a `uint32` CRC-32 of the transform path), `typeID`, and `attribute`. Curves live in ONE flat index space; each binding consumes a contiguous run whose width depends on the attribute (`extraction/characters/unity_bind.py:37`):

| attribute | meaning | curves |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ATTR_POSITION` | 3 |
| 2 | `ATTR_ROTATION` (quaternion) | 4 |
| 3 | `ATTR_SCALE` | 3 |
| 4 | `ATTR_EULER` (degrees) | 3 |

Any non-Transform binding is width 1 (`unity_bind.py:121`). `walk_bindings` (`unity_bind.py:128`) walks the list accumulating widths, assigning each binding `curve_start` and `curve_count` - the exact inverse of Unity's own `ClipBindingConstant::FindBinding`.

`path_hash` is `zlib.crc32(path.encode("utf-8")) & 0xFFFFFFFF`, with `""` mapping to `0` (`unity_bind.py:52`). The digest is ASSERTED, not assumed: `validate_hash_fn` (`unity_bind.py:74`) checks it against the controller's `m_TOS` (a hash→string debug table Unity ships) and raises unless at least 8 entries agree. A hit rate of 1.0 is not expected - `m_TOS` mixes true transform paths with state-machine labels like `Base Layer.JUMP.Fall`, which use a different digest.

### 7.2 The three concurrent encodings

The clip container is `m_MuscleClip.m_Clip` (unwrap UnityPy's extra nested `"data"` key, `clips.py:328`). Its curves concatenate in this exact order:

```
[ m_StreamedClip curves ][ m_DenseClip curves ][ m_ConstantClip curves ]
```

**STREAMED** (`clips.py:100`). `m_StreamedClip.data` is a list of `uint32` words; reinterpret as a little-endian byte stream of variable-length frames:

```
offset  size  type   field
0       4     f32    time
4       4     i32    keyCount
8       20*keyCount  keys
  per key (stride 20):
    +0    4   i32    curveIndex
    +4   16   f32[4] c0, c1, c2, c3
```

Unity brackets the real frames with sentinels at non-finite `time`; those frames are parsed but their keys are discarded (`clips.py:123`). A `keyCount` outside `[0, 2²⁰]` or a short read terminates the walk. Keys are grouped by `curveIndex` and sorted by time. The stored coefficients are the CUBIC of the segment STARTING at that key:

```
v(dt) = c0·dt³ + c1·dt² + c2·dt + c3        dt = t − keyTime
```

Evaluated directly (`clips.py:133`), with the segment chosen as the last key at or before `t`, clamped to the first key. Converting to Hermite tangents and back only loses precision.

**DENSE** (`clips.py:147`). `m_SampleArray` is frame-major: `sample[frame * m_CurveCount + curve]`. Frame `f` sits at `m_BeginTime + f / m_SampleRate`. Reconstruction is linear between neighbouring frames, clamped at both ends. A single-frame dense clip is constant.

**CONSTANT**. `m_ConstantClip.data[i]` is one `f32` for all time.

`_CurveSet.evaluate` (`clips.py:185`) resolves an absolute curve index by subtracting the streamed and then the dense counts. `curveCount` from `m_StreamedClip`, `m_CurveCount` from `m_DenseClip`, and `len(m_ConstantClip.data)` must sum to the width claimed by the binding list, or the build fails (`clips.py:334`). That assertion is the whole reason to trust the output: a mis-sliced curve space produces animation that looks plausible while being wrong.

### 7.3 Resampling to a uniform grid

```
start       = m_MuscleClip.m_StartTime
stop        = m_MuscleClip.m_StopTime
duration    = max(0, stop − start)
rate        = m_DenseClip.m_SampleRate  or  AnimationClip.m_SampleRate  or  30.0
frameCount  = clamp(round(duration * rate) + 1, 1, 8192)
times[f]    = clamp(start + f / rate, start, stop)
loop        = m_MuscleClip.m_LoopTime
```

(`clips.py:344-357`, `MAX_FRAMES = 8192` at `clips.py:50`, `DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE = 30.0` at `clips.py:48`.) All three encodings are baked onto this one grid, so the consumer ships exactly one sampler and adding a character can never introduce a new decode path. Because `frameCount` is `round(duration·rate) + 1`, the LAST frame sits exactly at `duration` - the consumer's index math depends on this.

### 7.4 Rotation channels

Quaternion curves (attribute 2) are `Transform.localRotation` values: `coords.quats` and nothing else (`clips.py:396`). They are then made **sign-continuous** - walk frames forward, negate the whole quaternion whenever `dot(q[i], q[i-1]) < 0` (`clips.py:289`). Component-wise curve storage legally produces `q` and `−q` on adjacent frames, identical rotations that a naive nlerp walks the long way between.

Euler curves (attribute 4) are degrees, composed as `Rz(z) @ Ry(y) @ Rx(x)` - the intrinsic sequence X, then Y, then Z, i.e. **Maya's default XYZ rotate order**, matching a Maya-authored rig with `Base Human*` bone names (`clips.py:214-240`). This is NOT `Quaternion.Euler`'s ZXY order. The result is converted to a quaternion with a branch-per-largest-diagonal matrix→quaternion (`clips.py:243`), returned in RAW Unity space, and only then passed through `coords.quats` - so exactly one place knows about the mirror. **Euler only wins where the clip supplied no quaternion curve for that bone** (`clips.py:405-408`). How many shipped clips actually reach that branch is unverified; treat it as the less-exercised path.

### 7.5 Output shape

A `BoneTrack` (`clips.py:57`) holds `position (F,3) f32`, `rotation (F,4) f32 xyzw`, `scale (F,3) f32`, each independently `None` when the clip does not drive that channel - in which case the bind-pose value stands. Tracks are emitted sorted by bone index. Bindings that do not resolve to a rig bone (Animator float parameters, unbound properties) are counted and reported, never silently dropped (`clips.py:76`). Measured on the Tagilla pack: 117 clips, 78 distinct bones animated (every non-root bone), `unresolvedBindings` between 7 and 185 per clip, 1,496 in total.

---

## 8. Root motion and the derived forward axis

Root motion is **found, not assumed** (`clips.py:412-431`). Walk the tracks in bone order; the first (hence lowest-indexed, nearest the rig root) bone whose animated position spans more than `ROOT_MOTION_EPS = 0.02 m` on any axis is the carrier. Every other bone's position curve merely restates its constant bind offset, so the threshold separates them cleanly.

```
root_motion[f] = position[f] − position[0]          # (F,3), viewer space
position[f]    = position[0]  for all f             # the bone is pinned
average_speed  = root_motion[-1] / duration         # m/s, viewer space
```

The travel is STRIPPED off the bone track into its own channel so no consumer can double-apply it: walk physics already moves the character through the world, and leaving 4 m of forward travel in the skeleton slides the body out from under the camera.

Measured on the Tagilla pack: 109 of 117 clips carry root motion; the carrier is bone 1 (`Root_Joint`) in 100 clips, bone 2 (`Base HumanPelvis`) in 6, bone 14 (`Base HumanGear1`) in 3. `walk_aim_0` travels 2.502 m/s over 1.600 s at 30 Hz (49 frames).

**Facing is derived, never authored** (`extraction/characters/build_character.py:455-472`). Take the forward-walk clip (default name `walk_aim_0`, overridable per character), zero its Y component, normalise, and write it as `characterForward`. Measured for Tagilla: `[0, 0, 1]`, flagged `characterForwardDerived: true`. The consumer aligns character-forward to movement direction with no magic 180° (`viewer/src/character/drive.rs:326`). `characterForwardDerived: false` means the value fell back to `+Z` and must not be trusted.

## 9. The animator controller graph

`extraction/characters/controller.py:238` reads an `AnimatorController` typetree. This is a DATA extraction, not a reimplementation of Unity's Animator. UnityPy nests serialized structs under an extra `"data"` key, so every access goes through `_d` (`controller.py:32`).

**Parameters** come from `m_Controller.m_Values.m_ValueArray`; names resolve through `m_TOS` by `m_ID`; defaults come from `m_DefaultValues.m_Float/Int/BoolValues` indexed by `m_Index`. Type ids are `{1: float, 3: int, 4: bool, 5: trigger, 9: bool}` (`controller.py:29`). Measured on `TagillaBotAnimController`: 100 parameters, including `Direct_X`, `Direct_Y`, `Speed`, `Level`, `Sprint`, `Tilt`, `Aim_angle`.

**Layers** come from `m_LayerArray`. Blending is `{0: override, 1: additive}`. Critically, several layers legitimately share one state machine, and **the FIRST layer to reference a machine owns it**; later ones are synced views (`controller.py:288-295`). Building the map with a comprehension instead attributes every base-layer state to the LAST synced layer. Measured (Tagilla, 13 layers): layers 0 (`Base Layer`), 3 (`Sync_SprintHands`) and 10 (`TagillaSyncLayerForRegularOperations`) all point at state machine 0; only layer 0 owns it.

**States** come from each `m_StateMachineArray[i].m_StateConstantArray[]`. `m_FullPathID` and `m_NameID` resolve through `m_TOS` to `"Base Layer.StateMachine_Move.MOVE"` and `"MOVE"`. Preserved: `m_Speed`, `m_Loop`, `m_Mirror`, `m_CycleOffset`, `m_SpeedParamID`.

**Blend trees NEST, and they hang off the STATE.** `m_BlendTreeConstantArray` is on the state; `m_BlendTreeConstantIndexArray` has one entry per synchronized-layer slot indexing into it, with `−1` meaning "this state contributes nothing on that layer" (`controller.py:383`). Measured: Tagilla's `MOVE` has `trees` of length 3.

Node parsing (`controller.py:408`) is recursive with a `seen` cycle guard. A node with no `m_ChildIndices` is a LEAF regardless of its `m_BlendType` byte; `m_ClipID == 0xFFFFFFFF` means "no clip" and is emitted as `−1`. Blend types: `{0: 1d, 1: 2d_simple_directional, 2: 2d_freeform_directional, 3: 2d_freeform_cartesian, 4: direct}` (`controller.py:48`). A child's position in its PARENT's blend space is stored ON the child: `threshold` from `m_Blend1dData.m_ChildThresholdArray[n]`, `position` from `m_Blend2dData.m_ChildPositionArray[n]`.

Measured on the Tagilla pack: `trees[0]`, `Base Layer.StateMachine_Move.MOVE`, is a `2d_freeform_cartesian` on `(Direct_X, Direct_Y)` with 9 children. Eight of them - at positions `(0,1)`, `(1,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,−1)`, `(0,−1)`, `(−1,−1)`, `(−1,0)`, `(−1,1)` - are themselves `2d_freeform_cartesian` nodes on `(Speed, Level)` with 6 children each; child index 8 is a `1d` node on parameter `Direct` with 4 children. The whole tree is 86 nodes and 72 clip leaves. `trees[2]` is a `2d_simple_directional` on `(Direct_X, Direct_Y)` with 1 child. A flat "root's children" read returns nine nodes with no clips at all.

**Transitions** come from `m_TransitionConstantArray`: destination (via `m_DestinationState` through `m_TOS`, reduced to its LEAF name), `m_TransitionDuration`, `m_TransitionOffset`, `m_ExitTime`, `m_HasExitTime`, and `(parameterName, m_ConditionMode, m_EventThreshold)` triples from `m_ConditionConstantArray`. `m_ConditionMode` is passed through as Unity's raw enum.

**Gameplay metadata** is joined by name from the bundle's `PlayerStateContainer` MonoBehaviours (`controller.py:309-329`), keeping `Type`, `IsDefaultState`, `AdditionalDirectionInfo`, `RotationSpeedClamp`, `StateSensitivity`, `CanInteract`, `DisableRootMotion`, `CreateUniqueMovementStateObject`, `AnimationAuthority`. Measured on the Tagilla pack: 0 states matched - that bundle ships no `PlayerStateContainer`, so every state's `gameplay` is `{}`. It is populated for controllers that do ship them.

**Clip ids, not clip names.** `clipNames` is for humans and is NOT unique: measured on the Tagilla pack, `crouch_run_aim_0` appears twice in `clipNames`, backed by two distinct assets. That only one of the two is an absolute-pose clip (the other being an additive delta) is stated at `extraction/characters/pack.py:45-47` and `viewer/src/character/pack.rs:239-240` and is unverified. `clipIndexById[controller_clip_id] → index into the pack's clips[]`, or `−1` when not extracted, is the authoritative resolution (`extraction/characters/pack.py:40-53`). Deduplication at build time is by asset `path_id`, never by name (`build_character.py:368-380`). Measured: 847 clip slots, 117 extracted for the `locomotion` set.

Clip sets name STATES, and the build expands each to every clip its blend trees reach (`build_character.py:336-366`). Use FULL paths - leaf names recur across layers. A set that resolves to zero clips is a hard error, not an empty pack.

## 10. Equipment and attachment binding

EFT's headwear and facecover items are **not skinned**: the prefab is `MeshFilter` + `MeshRenderer` with zero bindposes and no bone hashes, so the item rides a bone rather than deforming (`extraction/characters/skin.py:92-101`). `load_attachment` (`skin.py:572`) reads them.

The mesh's local transform is composed up to the prefab root by walking `m_Father` (guard depth 64), multiplying `parent @ local` with every level already conjugated, then decomposed back to `(pos, xyzw quat, scale)` for storage (`skin.py:640-671`). Scale is the per-column norm of the basis; the rotation is that basis divided by the scale, converted with the same matrix→quaternion routine the clip decoder uses. Measured: the Tagilla welding-mask prefab carries `localRot = (−0.7071, 0, 0, 0.7071)` - the −90° X fixup these prefabs use - with unit scale and zero translation.

Every attachment vertex is pinned to the target bone with full weight (`jointIndex = (0,0,0,0)`, `jointWeight = (1,0,0,0)`) so the same vertex layout and the same shader path serve skinned and rigid geometry (`skin.py:717-719`). Prefabs shipping both a `_base` and a `_custom` variant of one mesh keep only `_base`; taking both draws the item twice (`skin.py:690`).

**The slot→bone mapping is NOT in the asset.** The `Dress` component lists only renderers and a decal type; the real mapping lives in the runtime's `PlayerBody.SlotView`. So the target bone comes from the registry (`extraction/characters/characters.json`, e.g. `"bone": "Base HumanHead"` → index 24) and is an explicit authoring choice, flagged as such. This is the one place in the character pipeline where a value is authored rather than derived.

The weapon uses a different mechanism: no attachment record at all. The consumer looks up the rig bone named `Weapon_root` (measured index 68) and parents the `.eftweap` mesh under an identity offset node (`viewer/src/character/weapon.rs:21`, `viewer/src/character/mod.rs:171-226`). The rig also ships `weapon_holster` (75) and `weapon_holster1` (76) for the slung pose.

---

## 11. The `.eftchar` container: exact byte layout

```
<pack>/manifest.json
<pack>/skin.bin
<pack>/anim.bin
<pack>/textures/*.png
```

`version` is `1` (`extraction/characters/pack.py:27`). All binary is little-endian.

### 11.1 `skin.bin`

Two blocks, in this order:

```
[ every mesh's vertex block, then every attachment's vertex block ]   <- vertexBlockByteLength
[ every mesh's index block,  then every attachment's index block  ]
```

Emission order within each block is `meshes[]` in manifest order followed by `attachments[]` in manifest order (`pack.py:102-169`). `vertexByteOffset` and `indexByteOffset` are ABSOLUTE within the file - the index offsets are computed as a local cursor and then shifted by `vertexBlockByteLength` once the vertex block is closed (`pack.py:165-169`). A consumer can memory-map and slice with no walk.

**Vertex layout - interleaved, stride 72 bytes** (`extraction/characters/skin.py:34`, declared in the manifest as `vertexLayout`):

| offset | size | format | attribute |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 0 | 12 | `f32x3` | `position` |
| 12 | 12 | `f32x3` | `normal` |
| 24 | 16 | `f32x4` | `tangent` (w = handedness) |
| 40 | 8 | `f32x2` | `uv0` (V already flipped) |
| 48 | 8 | `u16x4` | `jointIndex` (GLOBAL rig indices) |
| 56 | 16 | `f32x4` | `jointWeight` (sums to 1) |

`vertexByteLength == vertexCount * stride` is asserted by the loader (`viewer/src/character/pack.rs:550`).

**Indices**: `u32`, `indexFormat: "u32"`, mesh-local (0-based within that mesh's own vertex block), winding already reversed. `indexByteLength == indexCount * 4`.

Per-mesh manifest fields: `name`, `part`, `view` (`"third"` | `"first"`, defaulting to `"third"` for packs predating the field), `lod`, `vertexCount`, `vertexByteOffset`, `vertexByteLength`, `indexCount`, `indexByteOffset`, `indexByteLength`, `boundBones` (sorted rig indices, debug/validation), `inverseBindposes` (a `boneCount`-long array of 16-float **row-major** rows), and `submeshes[]` of `{material, indexStart, indexCount}` where `indexStart` is in INDICES relative to this mesh's block.

Measured on the Tagilla pack (LOD 0): `Top_Boss_Tagilla_lod0` 8,560 verts at offset 0 (616,320 bytes), 2 submeshes (24,654 + 15,834 indices); `Pants_BOSS_Tagilla_lod0` 2,558 verts at 616,320; `vertexBlockByteLength` 916,920; total 1,147,296 bytes.

Attachment entries add `bone`, `localPos [3]`, `localRot [4] xyzw`, `localScale [3]` and otherwise share the same fields and the same vertex layout, so the loader has one parser.

### 11.2 `anim.bin`

Purely sequential, no header. For each clip in `clips[]` order, for each track in the clip's track order (bone-index ascending), the PRESENT channels are appended in the fixed order **position, rotation, scale**; then, if the clip has root motion, its `(F,3)` array (`pack.py:180-213`).

```
position : F * 3 * 4 bytes,  f32 xyz
rotation : F * 4 * 4 bytes,  f32 xyzw, sign-continuous within the clip
scale    : F * 3 * 4 bytes,  f32 xyz
rootMotion: F * 3 * 4 bytes, f32 xyz, displacement relative to frame 0
```

Each is described in the manifest by `{byteOffset, byteLength, components}` with `byteOffset` absolute in the file. Absent channels have no entry at all, and the consumer then uses the bind-pose value. Measured on the Tagilla pack: clip `Fall`, `frameCount = 2`, track bone 1 → position `{0, 24, 3}`, rotation `{24, 32, 4}`, scale `{56, 24, 3}`.

Per-clip manifest fields: `name`, `duration` (s), `sampleRate` (Hz), `frameCount`, `loop`, `averageSpeed [3]` or `null`, `unresolvedBindings` (count), `rootMotion` (`{bone, byteOffset, byteLength, components}` or `null`), `tracks[]`.

### 11.3 `manifest.json` top level

`version`, `id`, `displayName`, `source {gameBuild, bundles[]}`, `conventions`, `skeleton`, `vertexLayout`, `indexFormat`, `defaultLod`, `meshes[]`, `attachments[]`, `materials[]`, `textures[]`, `clips[]`, `controller`, `blobs {skin {file, vertexBlockByteLength, totalByteLength}, anim {file, totalByteLength}}`, plus `characterForward [3]` and `characterForwardDerived` merged in by the builder.

`conventions` (`extraction/characters/coords.py:109`) is the block a loader asserts against:

```json
{"coordSystem":"viewer","g3":[-1,1,1],"quatOrder":"xyzw","windingFlipped":true,
 "tangentHandednessFlipped":true,"uvVFlipBaked":true,"upAxis":"y","unit":"meter"}
```

`skeleton` carries `boneCount`, `names[]`, `paths[]`, `parents[]` (`−1` for the root), `localPos[][3]`, `localRot[][4]`, `localScale[][3]`.

The Rust loader hard-fails on: `version != 1`; `g3 != [-1,1,1]`; `uvVFlipBaked == false` (the field is `#[serde(default)]`, so a pack predating it is rejected); `windingFlipped == false`; any skeleton array whose length differs from `boneCount`; `parents[i] >= i`; `vertexByteLength != vertexCount * stride`; a missing required vertex attribute; a bindpose table not `boneCount` long or a row not 16 floats; a decoded index count differing from `indexCount`; a channel range past the blob; a channel `byteLength` not divisible by 4; a channel float count differing from `frameCount * components`; a track or attachment targeting a bone ≥ `boneCount` (`viewer/src/character/pack.rs:453-484, 489-517, 546-629, 656-700, 736-774`).

---

## 12. What is dropped

Stated plainly, because a reimplementer will look for these and they are not there.

- **Blend shapes / morph targets.** `Mesh.m_Shapes` is never read anywhere in the package. There is no blend-shape channel in the vertex layout, the manifest, or `anim.bin`.
- **IK.** `Layer.m_IKPass` is recorded as a boolean (`controller.py:303`) and nothing consumes it. The rig's IK helper bones (`IK_S_LPalm` 71, `IK_S_RPalm` 72, `Bend_Goal_Left` 69, `Bend_Goal_Right` 70) are extracted as ordinary bones, animated if a clip drives them, and never solved. No foot planting, no hand-to-weapon IK.
- **Avatar / body masks.** `m_SkeletonMask` and any `AvatarMask` asset are not read. Every layer, if evaluated, would affect every bone.
- **Layer stack.** The controller's layers are extracted as metadata (index, name, blending mode, default weight, owning state machine, synchronized index) but the pose evaluator runs ONE override state at a time plus a single hand-picked additive state. Measured: `TagillaBotAnimController` has 13 layers; the consumer evaluates the base layer's tree plus `Additive_ISaim.idle_aim_AimIn` (`viewer/src/character/drive.rs:55-56, 434-450`).
- **State-machine execution.** Transitions, conditions, exit times and `m_ConditionMode` are all extracted, but the consumer runs its own small explicit machine and uses the graph only for cross-fade DURATIONS (`viewer/src/character/pack.rs:407`). Sub-state-machines, any-state transitions and entry/exit nodes are not modelled.
- **`m_AdditiveReferencePose`.** Not read by anything in the package. The additive reference is the clip's own frame 0 (`viewer/src/character/anim.rs:149-154`); that this matches the shipped reference pose for these clips rests on that source comment and is unverified.
- **Legacy clips.** `m_Legacy` clips raise immediately - their curves live in `m_RotationCurves`, which is unhandled (`clips.py:319`).
- **Humanoid / muscle clips.** Not handled. The absence of `m_MuscleClip` is a hard error (`clips.py:324`); the presence of humanoid muscle bindings is not decoded.
- **Root-motion tables.** `rootMotion` bundle paths are recorded in the registry and resolved by `appearance.controller_for`, but nothing parses them. Per-clip average speed from stripped root motion is used instead.
- **`m_Events`, curve tangent modes, per-clip wrap modes** other than `m_LoopTime`.
- **Second UV set, vertex colours.** Only `m_UV0` is read (`skin.py:462`).

---

## 13. Consumer-side math: pose, blend, skin

Reproduce this and the pack plays correctly in any engine.

**Sampling** (`viewer/src/character/anim.rs:99`). Because `frameCount = round(duration·rate) + 1`, the last frame is exactly at `duration`:

```
t  = looping ? rem_euclid(time, duration) : clamp(time, 0, duration)
f  = (t / duration) * (frameCount − 1)
i0 = min(floor(f), frameCount − 1);  i1 = min(i0 + 1, frameCount − 1);  a = f − i0
```

Position and scale lerp; rotation slerps (within a clip the emitter already made the sequence sign-continuous, so the short arc is guaranteed).

**Blending is weighted accumulation per bone, not a chain of pairwise lerps** (`anim.rs:21-96`). A 2D blend can have nine active clips. Accumulate `pos += p·w`, `scale += s·w`, and for rotation add the quaternion as a `Vec4` after aligning it to the first contribution's hemisphere (`dot < 0 → negate`), then normalise (nlerp). **Weight is tracked PER BONE, PER CHANNEL**: clips in a blend legitimately drive different bone subsets, and normalising by the blend's total weight instead shrinks the untouched bones toward zero. Where a channel's accumulated weight is `≤ 1e-5`, fall back to the bind pose value.

**Blend-tree evaluation** (`anim.rs:203`). Recursive, multiplying the parent's weight into each child, pruning below `1e-5`, then renormalising the leaf weights (gaps from unextracted clips and float error both leave the sum off; an unnormalised pose reads as the character sinking or shrinking).

- `1d`: linear between the two bracketing `threshold`s, clamped outside the range.
- `direct`: uniform `1/n`.
- every 2D flavour: **gradient band interpolation** - for child `i`, `wᵢ = minⱼ≠ᵢ clamp(1 − ((sample − posᵢ)·(posⱼ − posᵢ)) / |posⱼ − posᵢ|², 0, 1)`, then normalise; degenerate case snaps to the nearest child. This IS Unity's algorithm for Freeform Cartesian; for the two Directional flavours Unity uses a polar variant, so this is an APPROXIMATION there.

**Additive layers** (`anim.rs:155`). Reference is the clip's frame 0. Per bone: `out.rot = slerp(identity, q_sampled · q_frame0⁻¹, w) · out.rot`, and `out.pos += (p_sampled − p_frame0) · w`. Time is CLAMPED, never wrapped - these are aim-in transitions being scrubbed, and wrapping snaps back to neutral.

**Skinning.** Standard linear blend skinning with the pack's own bindposes:

```
skin(v) = Σᵢ wᵢ · World(joint[i]) · InverseBindpose[joint[i]] · v
```

where `World(b)` is the forward-pass product of local TRS matrices from the root, `parent @ local`. Because the tables are rig-sized and joint indices are global, one joint palette serves every mesh and every attachment of the character.

**Root motion is NOT re-applied** by the consumer. It is stripped from the bone tracks; the driver instead uses `|averageSpeed.xz|` to rate-match playback so feet do not skate (`viewer/src/character/drive.rs:383-391`, `viewer/src/npc.rs`). A consumer that also wants the clip's travel must read the `rootMotion` channel explicitly.

---

## 14. The weapon hold through a cross-fade

**A local-space blend does not preserve a world-space relationship between two chains, and the weapon hold is one.** This is not a bug in the blend - §13's per-bone accumulation is what Mecanim does and what the pack's own consumer must do - it is a consequence of it that anything stitching clips together has to correct.

The two chains are different lengths:

```
Weapon_root       <- Base HumanRibcage                             4 joints from the root
Base HumanRPalm   <- RForearm3 <- .. <- RCollarbone <- Ribcage     6 joints further out
```

Every joint in a fade contributes its own interpolated rotation, so through the window the weapon and the hands travel different arcs and separate. Measured with `out/characters/scav` on the repo's own action shots:

| shot | rifle off the right hand | left hand off the rifle |
|---|---|---|
| `a02_sprint-stop` | 90 mm peak | 139 mm peak |
| `a03_prone-crawl` | 110 mm peak | 204 mm peak |
| `a01_firing-beat` | 41 mm peak | 144 mm peak |

**The source data is not at fault.** Within a single clip `Weapon_root` is rigid to the right palm to under 1 mm in **573 of 662 clips**, and rigid to BOTH palms in **445**. The 89 that are not rigid are the grenade (`rgd5_*`), holster (`idle_weapon_in`/`_out`), melee (`axe_look`, `knife_look`) and vault (`Start_Top`/`End_Top`) clips, where the weapon genuinely leaves the hand. The grip offset is **not** a rig constant - it differs between clips by up to 1593 mm - so it must be read per clip and per frame, never baked.

### 14.1 The clips that key no weapon at all

A second, independent defect, and on a stitched shot it is the **louder** of the two. **33 of the 662 clips have no `Weapon_root` track whatsoever** - `Fall`, `Fall_End`, `Jump_*_Sprint`, the whole `Prone_Turn_*` fan, `Start/Move/End_Top` (vault), `Stand_Kick`, `T_Pose`, `GUI_EmptyHands_Idle_0`, `stand_Idle_no_weapons_0`, and `Transition_Sprint_to_Stand`.

That is not corruption. The game's controller runs ten layers and weapon handling is its own, so a base-locomotion clip legitimately keys only the body and lets another layer place the weapon. **Offline there is no such layer**, and `_clip_locals` fills an unkeyed bone from the **rest local** (`tools/blender/import_eftchar.py:682-684`) - so the rifle parks near the ribcage and stays there while the arms move. This is wrong for the clip's **entire length**, fade or no fade, which is why it reads far worse on screen than the blend artefact: the weapon ends up floating at head height with no hand near it.

Measured on `Transition_Sprint_to_Stand`, which the `a02_sprint-stop` shot uses: the rest fallback sits **148 mm** from where `Weapon_root_3rd_anim` puts it and its distance to the right palm wanders over **109-194 mm** across the segment, against the 184.7 mm the neighbouring `sprint_slow_0` holds rigidly.

**`Weapon_root_3rd_anim` is not the substitute it looks like.** On two locomotion clips the two bones are world-identical, which invites treating one as a mirror of the other - but across the **629 clips that key both, they diverge by up to 420 mm** (mean 4.3 mm). It is a different bone with its own job.

What is available is the grip the *neighbouring* clips authored, so the socket is carried across the gap: every active clip votes with its own weight, one that keys the weapon voting for the grip it authored and one that does not voting for the grip already being carried. The value therefore eases from the outgoing clip's grip into the incoming clip's across a fade and holds flat in between, instead of snapping when the last keyed clip drops out of the blend. The weapon is then hung off the right palm at that grip.

Scope check on the repo's own shots: of the six action shots, exactly **one armed shot** is affected (`a02_sprint-stop`, via `Transition_Sprint_to_Stand`). `a05_melee` uses `Stand_Kick`/`Stand_Kick_Fail` but draws no weapon.

### 14.2 Which correction, and why not the obvious one

Moving the **weapon** onto the right hand is the obvious fix and it is the wrong one. It pins the rifle to the right palm exactly, but it drags the rifle away from wherever the left arm's blend put it: measured, the left hand went from 139 mm off the foregrip to **304 mm** off it. It converts one artefact into a worse one.

The correction is to leave the weapon on its blended local and **solve both arms onto it**. The weapon rides a short chain so its blended pose is already close to authored; the palms are what the blend throws off, so the palms are what to correct. This is also what the game does - the Player prefab runs `FullBodyBipedIK` / `SimpleTIK` *after* the Mecanim blend, and the rig ships `IK_S_LPalm` / `IK_S_RPalm` effectors and `Bend_Goal_Left` / `Bend_Goal_Right` pole targets for exactly that pass. In the shipped curves those effectors are coincident with the palms to **0.0 mm**, i.e. the clip data already contains the solved result, so reproducing the solve at the blend is the whole job.

### 14.3 The solve

`tools/blender/weapon_hold.py`, pure numpy so it is testable outside Blender. Per frame, only when more than one clip is active:

0. Carry the socket across any clip that keys no weapon (§14.1), so the reference frame the next two steps read against is a real one.
1. For each active clip `i` at its own local time, FK that clip alone and take the grip it authored, `Gᵢ = World_i(Weapon_root)⁻¹ · World_i(palm)`. A clip that keys no weapon is read against the SAME carried socket, so its authored palms reproduce exactly at `w=1`.
2. Blend the `Gᵢ` on TRS with the same weights and hemisphere-aligned nlerp as the pose blend, and hang the result off the blended weapon: `target = World(Weapon_root) · Ḡ`.
3. Analytic two-bone IK per arm onto that target - law of cosines for the elbow's position along the shoulder→target axis, `Bend_Goal_*` for which way it swings out of it. The three `Forearm1..3` twist bones keep their locals so their share of the roll rides along; the palm's local is then set to land the wrist on the authored grip **orientation** as well as its position.

Two properties make this safe to leave on:

- **With one active clip it is a no-op** - the target is that clip's own palm - so an unfaded frame is untouched and nothing outside a fade window can regress. The implementation skips the work entirely rather than relying on it cancelling.
- **It assumes no rigidity.** The grip is read per frame, so the 89 clips where the hand really does leave the weapon reproduce exactly as authored.

Elbows are never driven past `0.999` of reach: at full extension the IK plane is undefined and the joint pops between frames.

**Result** on the same three shots: both hands land on the authored grip to **0.000 mm** on every frame, with 29 to 190 mm of arm reach still in hand and zero reach clamps.

### 14.4 Scope

This corrects the hold. It does **not** correct foot contact, which breaks through a fade for the same reason and has its own remedy (`foot_driven_positions`, derived from the planted toe rather than the root-motion channel). A fade between clips that disagree about speed still skates by `~0.5 · Δv · blend` metres regardless of either; that is a *staging* problem, fixed by feeding a transition the clip it was authored to follow.

---

## 15. Invariants and their failure signatures

The "what you SEE" column records observations from the source notes taken when each invariant was broken; those signatures are not reproducible from the repo as it stands.

| invariant | how it breaks | what you SEE |
|---|---|---|
| `G3` applied exactly once, per datum | applied twice, or applied to the composed world matrix on top of already-conjugated locals | the character is mirrored back into Unity space; he stands correctly but faces the wrong way relative to the map, and left/right equipment swaps |
| winding reversed for an `X`-mirrored mesh | forgotten | every triangle faces away; the body renders inside-out or vanishes under back-face culling. The loader refuses a pack with `windingFlipped: false` |
| tangent `w` negated | forgotten | normal-mapped detail lights from the mirrored side; a face shades convex where it should be concave, and the error is invisible on flat surfaces |
| quaternion conjugated as `(x,−y,−z,w)` | using `(−x,y,z,w)` (naively "the same as a point") | the rig is connected, every quaternion is unit, positions match the bind pose exactly - and every pose composes to a body tilted 60–130° from vertical with legs folded to half reach and feet floating. This is what `validate.py` exists to catch |
| euler order `Rz@Ry@Rx` (Maya XYZ) | using Unity's `Quaternion.Euler` ZXY | same signature as above, but only on euler-encoded clips, so a character animates correctly in one state and folds in another |
| UV V flipped exactly once | skipped, or done again in the shader | textures sample upside down. On a face this reads as a subtle "UV mapping issue", not an obvious break. The loader refuses a pack with `uvVFlipBaked: false` |
| bindpose ≠ rest pose | using the skeleton's bind-pose world matrix as the inverse bindpose instead of the mesh's own `m_BindPose` | the mesh explodes or collapses toward the origin at spawn, before any clip plays. Diagnostic: freeze the rig in its bind pose (`EFT_CHARACTER_BIND=1`) - if it is still wrong, skinning is wrong, not the pose pipeline |
| bone remap from the authoritative source | trusting `Skin._bonePaths` over `Mesh.m_BoneNameHashes` | limbs animate to the wrong joints - an arm follows the leg. Recorded shipped disagreements: `usec_upper_commando` shifted two slots, `Top_BOSS_Killa_base` a different length (49 vs 48) |
| `parents[i] < i` | unsorted hierarchy | a forward-pass world-matrix computation reads a parent that has not been written yet: children lag one frame or jitter. Both emitter and loader assert it |
| binding curve widths sum to the clip's curve count | assuming a width, or ignoring the euler attribute | curves are read one slot off; the animation is smooth, connected, unit-quaternion clean, and completely wrong. The build fails on the sum mismatch |
| hands solved onto the weapon after a cross-fade | leaving the raw local blend | the rifle floats out of the grip for the length of the fade - the left fist hangs in mid-air below the magwell and the gun hovers over a closed right hand. Peaks at 90-204 mm on this pack, and motion blur on a final render HIDES it, so it survives review and shows up in playback |
| root motion stripped once | leaving it in the track AND moving the character | the body slides out from under the camera along the clip's own axis |
| clip resolved by controller id, not name | resolving by name | you get the additive-DELTA twin of a clip and play its deltas as absolute poses; the character folds only in the states that happen to hit the duplicate |
| joint weights sum to 1 | Unity's stored weights used raw | vertices drift slightly toward the origin - a soft shrink most visible at the extremities |
| zero-weight influence clamped | left as whatever slot byte the exporter wrote | an out-of-range joint index reads garbage from the palette; stray vertices shoot to infinity as long spikes |
| `_SpecMap` not bound to occlusion | bound anyway | every character surface multiplies down to a fifth of its ambient light, with hard seams where the atlas's gloss regions change (the "black skullcap with a seam across the scalp") |
| normal map repacked from DXT5nm | written raw | tangent normal ≈ `(1, y, z)`, pointing along the tangent instead of out of the surface; shading flips between lit and black as the head turns |

Anatomical validation (`extraction/characters/validate.py`) is the last line of defence, because a wrong rotation basis produces output that no structural check can detect. It composes the pose and measures, on reference clips resolved BY CLIP ID from standing-locomotion states (never by name). Bounds: lowest foot `y ∈ [−0.20, 0.45] m`; head `y ∈ [0.15, 2.05] m`; pelvis→head tilt from `+Y` `≤ 50°` (skipped for clips whose name contains `prone`); pelvis→foot reach `∈ [0.35, 1.15] m`; collarbone→palm reach `∈ [0.15, 0.80] m`; palm world `y ∈ [−0.10, 2.20] m`. Frames `0`, `F/3`, `2F/3` of each reference clip are measured. Arm reach is checked because a validator measuring only pelvis/head/feet POSITIONS passed a pose whose head was folded onto the chest and whose arms were inside the torso - three positions do not constrain a skeleton.

## 16. Old patterns

- **Hand-authored part lists.** `characters.json` used to carry hand-picked prefabs per character. Measured against the game, the authored scav was wrong: it wore `head_civilian_1`, which does not appear in the scav appearance table at all (the game rolls `wild_head_1/2/3/drozd/misha`), and it had no hands slot. Appearance is now rolled from the game's own weighted tables; `characters.json` survives for named one-offs and for the few facts the tables do not carry (the equipment slot→bone choice, controller overrides, clip sets).
- **A per-clip rotation basis chosen by scoring.** An earlier revision decoded each clip twice - with and without an extra X flip on the rotation curves - and selected the better-scoring decode with a `validate.choose_basis` helper. Neither `choose_basis` nor `clips._curve_quat_to_transform` exists in the current source; the names appear only in prose (`README.md:164`, `validate.py:10`, `validate.py:168`). The present decoder applies `coords.quats` uniformly to quaternion curves and to euler-derived quaternions, with no per-clip choice; the apparent need for one was an artefact of a broken euler conversion scoring the two encodings against each other (`clips.py:393-395`).
- **Zeroing bone 0's translation to remove root motion.** The carrier is not bone 0; measured on the Tagilla pack, it is bone 1 (`Root_Joint`) in 100 of 109 clips, bone 2 in 6 and bone 14 in 3. Root motion is now found by displacement threshold and stripped into its own channel (`viewer/src/character/drive.rs:453-457`).
- **A CAB index built by globbing `*.bundle`.** Every item whose geometry an extensionless bundle provides assembled to nothing. Bundles are now recognised by their UnityFS-family header. The scale of the miss recorded at `unity_deps.py:14-17` - 2,295 CABs across 1,160 extensionless bundles, taking with it Killa's 6B13 and rig, the 6B5 Flora, and eleven submeshes of the M4A1 - is unverified without a game install.
