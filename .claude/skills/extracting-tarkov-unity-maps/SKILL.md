  Documents the Escape From Tarkov Unity asset extraction pipeline: game files to dataset
  (scene.json + OBJ + PNG) to .eftpack (manifest.json, meshes.bin, instances.bin, materials.json,
  sidecars) to renderer. Covers the instance placement formula and the ban on TRS decomposition,
  the handedness conjugation, the OBJ vertex X-negation, the texture V-flip, terrain and MicroSplat,
  StaticDeferredDecal projectors, characters and skinned meshes, sky, particles, water, colliders,
  the light and SH irradiance bake, IL2CPP MonoBehaviour raw-payload reading, and the failure
  signature of every broken invariant. ALSO covers rebuilding a pack in another renderer: the
  Blender importers in tools/blender/, which channel means what per material role, nav routing, the
  solved follow camera, deriving sun and sky the pack does not ship, and the game grade. Use when
  extracting, placing, reimplementing (a Blender or Unreal importer), rendering a pack offline, or
  debugging EFT/Unity map geometry, textures, decals, lighting, gameplay data, or pack builds, and
  BEFORE editing any placement, coordinate, UV, or handedness convention.

# Extracting Tarkov Unity maps

**Read `docs/extraction/README.md` now.** It is the navigation layer and it routes to fourteen
reference documents. Ten describe the pipeline itself: geometry and placement, textures and
materials, terrain and the colour grade, decals, game data, colliders and the semantic name layer,
characters and animation, sky and particles and water, lighting and the irradiance bake, and the
build stages and pack format. Four describe rebuilding a pack somewhere else: `blender-import.md`
(the importers, the ported shader families, the two build modes), `game-parity.md` (making an
external renderer produce the GAME'S image, and how to prove it), `photorealism.md` (what to give
up for a photograph, ranked by payoff) and `photoreal-lowergamefidelity.md` (the tier that edits
the assets, and is therefore no longer parity at all).

`tools/blender/README.md` is the entry point for the scripts themselves: pipeline order,
prerequisites, and the two modes.

This file is only a discovery shim. The documentation lives in the repository, in plain markdown
with no tool-specific format, so that any agent, any importer author, and any person reading the
code can use the same source. Do not answer pipeline questions from this file alone.

The rules most often got wrong, so that a wrong turn is caught before the full read:

- Apply the raw 3x3 to vertices. **Never** decompose a world matrix to translation/rotation/scale;
  about 4% of instances carry legitimate shear that decomposition silently discards.
- Handedness is a **conjugation** `M' = G·M·G⁻¹` with `G = diag(-1,1,1)`, applied exactly once.
  Not a premultiply, and never together with reflecting the mesh vertices.
- OBJ vertices are already X-negated. That fixes local shape, not world handedness.
- The texture V-flip is baked into the UVs after tiling, once. There is never a U-flip.
- Decal projectors span local X and Z and project along local Y.
- A channel means what the material's ROLE says it means. Texture alpha is coverage on one family
  and smoothness on the next, and reading the wrong one never errors, it just deletes the surface.
- The pack ships no sun and no directional light at all. Sun and sky strength for an offline render
  are SOLVED against a viewer frame, never guessed; a path tracer is linear in each light's power,
  so two basis renders span the space.
- A spatial filter tests an instance's world AABB, never its centre or its translation. Pre-baked
  geometry ships an identity affine, and a 700 m terrain tile is larger than any radius.
- **Attach a thing in the frame it was AUTHORED in, and there is more than one.** The weapon is
  authored in the ENGINE bone frame, so it undoes the importer's `q4` bone-axis permutation. Rigid
  equipment is authored UNITY Y-UP (a prefab root at identity over a mesh node carrying one -90 deg
  X fixup), so it does not. This rig is +X-down-the-bone, so those two frames differ by exactly 90
  degrees: use the weapon's rule on a helmet and the crown points forward out of the face. Nothing
  errors, because the geometry is present, watertight and correctly textured, and only a render
  shows it.
- A whole class of bug here is SILENT: geometry composed in the wrong frame is never missing, only
  rotated or offset. When touching any frame, write down next to the code which frame each side is
  in, and verify by MEASURING a known axis (the head bone's up against the skull's) rather than by
  reading the render.
