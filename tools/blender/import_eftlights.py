"""Blender importer for the pack's practical lights (lights_*.json).

Standalone. Run inside Blender, then call ``import_eftlights(pack_dir, parent=..., center=...,
radius=...)``.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A map's sun lights the outdoors and nothing else. Every ceiling panel, strip
light, lamp and sign in Interchange is a Unity light object, and the pack ships 1,659 of them. Skip
them and every interior goes BLACK: seen through a window from outside, a lit shop reads as a flat
dark rectangle, which is easy to misdiagnose as a broken glass material because the pane is the
thing you are looking at. It is not the pane. It is the unlit room behind it.

FORMAT (docs/extraction/lighting-and-sh-bake.md). One JSON array per Unity scene, listed in
``manifest.sidecars.lightsAll``; ``sidecars.lights`` names only the primary one. Load them ALL and
de-dup by filename, exactly as the viewer does, or a multi-scene map loses whole buildings.

    name, type ("Point" | "Spot" | "Directional"), position[3] and direction[3] in RAW UNITY space,
    rotation[4] (xyzw), color[4] LINEAR, intensity, range, spotAngle, innerSpotAngle (both FULL
    angles, degrees), shadowType (Unity LightShadows: 0 None, 1 Hard, 2 Soft), on.

`direction` is already the extracted forward vector, so the quaternion never has to be touched.

ENERGY. The viewer accumulates ``color * intensity * EFT_LIGHT_SCALE * (1-(d/r)^2)^2 / d^2`` and
multiplies by N.L with no 1/pi (gpu_draw.wgsl). Blender's lambert does divide by pi, and a lamp of
P watts delivers P/(4.pi.d^2). Matching the far-field term gives

    watts = 4 * pi^2 * LIGHT_SCALE * intensity

which is why the numbers look large. A spot uses the same formula: Blender defines spot power as
the equivalent point power, so narrowing the cone does not brighten it.

RANGE has no Cycles equivalent. Unity's window culls the light hard at `range`; Blender's falloff
is pure inverse-square and never reaches zero. `cutoff_distance` is set for EEVEE, which honours
it, and Cycles simply lets the far tail run - visible only as a slight lift far from a lamp.

SHADOWS default to ON for every light regardless of `shadowType`. That flag is a Unity performance
decision, not an artistic one: 1,626 of Interchange's lights have it at None because real-time
shadow maps are expensive, and a path tracer that honours it leaks every interior lamp straight
through the walls into the street. Pass ``honour_shadow_flag=True`` to reproduce the game's own
shadowing instead.
