//! eft::nav — in-process CPU pathfinding over the baked layered-2.5D nav grid.
//!
//! This REPLACES the old external GPU pathfind server (NVIDIA-Warp/CUDA + Python GraphQL on :8091):
//! routing now runs entirely on the CPU, in-process, so it works on EVERY GPU (indeed with none) and
//! ships inside the exe with no Python/CUDA/server dependency. It is a faithful port of the web
//! viewer's proven `_route.js` A* — the same algorithm that already served as that viewer's fallback
//! whenever the GPU server was offline.
//!
//! DATA (baked once at build time by `bake_nav.py` on the author's GPU; shipped in the .eftpack):
//!   nav.json      — { min_x, min_z, res, nx, nz, n_layers(K), miss, climb, drop_max, ... }
//!   nav.bin       — f32[nx*nz*K]: cell (iz*nx+ix) layer l height at (iz*nx+ix)*K + l, ascending,
//!                    `miss` for empty layers. A layered 2.5-D heightfield (mall floors / floor-under-
//!                    canopy each get a layer).
//!   nav_door.bin  — u8[nx*nz]: 1 = door cell (forced passable; paths cross closed doors).
//!   nav_blk.bin   — u8[nx*nz*K]: per (cell,layer) 8-bit mask; bit d set = the edge to neighbour d is
//!                    blocked by a thin wall/fence (caught by a body-height ray at bake time).
//!
//! ALGORITHM: A* over nodes = cell*K + layer. A neighbour connects if step-up <= climb and
//! descent <= drop_max (doors bypass), the edge isn't in the block mask, and (for diagonals) it isn't
//! a corner-cut. Edge cost is true 3-D surface distance with a vertical penalty (`VERT`) so routes
//! prefer staying on one floor. `path` snaps the start onto the nearest real floor (spiral) and tries
//! the destination layers nearest the requested Y. `chain` visits every dest in the cheapest order
//! (exact TSP <= 7 stops, nearest-neighbour above); `tour` keeps a given order.
//!
//! Scratch uses per-query "generation" stamps instead of clearing M-sized arrays each call, so a
//! single A* costs O(nodes visited), not O(grid) — important for big maps + N^2 chain matrices.
