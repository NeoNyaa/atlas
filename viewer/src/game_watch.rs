//! Live game link — TarkovMonitor-style passive file watching (no game hooks).
//!
//! Everything here reads files EFT itself writes; nothing touches the game process:
//!   * `<game>\Logs\log_*\*application_NNN.log`   — `scene preset path:maps/<bundle>.bundle` tells us
//!     which map is loading -> in-place map swap (MapSwitch) so Atlas follows the raid.
//!   * `<game>\Logs\log_*\*push-notifications_NNN.log` — task status push messages (started/failed/finished,
//!     `message.type` 10/11/12, task id = `message.templateId` before the space) -> auto-track /
//!     auto-complete in the Tasks tab; `UserMatchOver` -> clear the player marker.
//!   * `Documents\Escape From Tarkov\Screenshots` — EFT embeds the player's WORLD POSITION and
//!     rotation quaternion in every screenshot filename ("...]_x, y, z_qx, qy, qz, qw (0).png").
//!     Each new screenshot becomes a live player fix: marker + facing in the 3D world, and the
//!     pathfinder's "you are here" pin, so routes start from the player (press the screenshot key
//!     in raid to update). Only YOUR OWN position — same mechanism tarkov.dev's map page uses.
//!
//! A background thread polls (~0.7 s) and sends parsed events over an mpsc channel; Bevy systems
//! apply them. Coordinates bridge with the same X-flip the whole pipeline uses:
//! viewer = (-x, y, z). Disable entirely with `EFT_GAME_LINK=0`.
//!
//! Remote renderer mode (`EFT_REMOTE_MODE=1`) keeps this passive link active but reads optional
//! network-visible roots from `EFT_SCREENSHOTS_DIR` and `EFT_GAME_LOGS_DIR`. The screenshot root
//! may contain zero-byte marker files: only each `.png` filename and modification time are read.
