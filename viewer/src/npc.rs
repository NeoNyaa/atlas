//! npc.rs — animated AI patrols, exactly where the game puts them.
//!
//! Spawns scavs (any `.eftchar` pack) on the pack's own `patrol_ways` — the waypoint polylines
//! the game's bots walk, extracted from its AI scene data — and drives them with the same
//! four-layer character stack the walk camera uses ([`character::pack`]/[`rig`]/[`anim`] plus a
//! small agent driver here instead of [`character::drive`]'s player input). Movement speed is
//! slaved to the blend's root motion (the game's own 2.5 m/s walk), so feet do not skate and
//! nothing is an authored constant. At each waypoint the agent pauses briefly, then walks on;
//! routes loop ping-pong like the game's patrols.
//!
//! THE CAST IS DERIVED, NOT AUTHORED. A patrol way whose game-side name/zone carries a boss
//! token (`KILLA_PATROL_ALT`, `ZoneTagilla`) walks that boss's character pack when one is built
//! (`out/characters/boss*`); PMC bodies wander the map's REAL PMC spawn clusters (side=pmc,
//! category `player`, grouped by the game's own infiltration zone), alternating the usec/bear
//! packs; everything else stays a scav. Missing packs degrade to scav, never to an error.
//!
//! `EFT_NPC=0` disables; `EFT_NPC_CHAR=<id>` forces ONE pack id for every agent (the old
//! behaviour, and still the right tool for eyeballing a single character).
