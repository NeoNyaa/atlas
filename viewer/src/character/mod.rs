//! eft::character — playable characters (Tagilla and friends) for the walk camera.
//!
//! Consumes the `.eftchar` packs emitted by `extraction/characters/build_character.py`. Four layers,
//! each independently replaceable:
//!
//! | module | role |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`pack`]  | `.eftchar` -> engine-agnostic data (skeleton, meshes, clips, state table) |
//! | [`rig`]   | that data -> Bevy entities: bone hierarchy + `SkinnedMesh` draws |
//! | [`anim`]  | clip sampling, blend-tree evaluation, weighted pose accumulation |
//! | [`drive`] | `WalkState` -> animator parameters -> state -> pose; third-person boom |
//!
//! Nothing here is Tagilla-specific: every character binds to the same 79-bone rig, so pointing
//! `EFT_CHARACTER` at another pack is the whole cost of swapping who you play.
//!
//! Skinning is Bevy's own (`bevy_mesh::skinning::SkinnedMesh` + the `bevy_pbr` joint palette), which
//! coexists with the map's custom `gpu_driven` pass the same way the POI markers and loot cubes do —
//! those are ordinary `Mesh3d` entities too.
