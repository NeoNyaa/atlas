//! Turning a loaded [`CharacterPack`] into live Bevy entities.
//!
//! Shape of what gets spawned:
//!
//! ```text
//! CharacterRoot (Transform: feet position + facing)
//!  ├── bone 0 "Skeleton" ── bone 1 "Root_Joint" ── ... 79 CharacterBone entities
//!  └── one entity per (mesh, submesh): Mesh3d + MeshMaterial3d + SkinnedMesh
//! ```
//!
//! Every skinned entity shares the SAME `joints` list — the whole rig in bone order — because the
//! emitter rewrote joint indices into global rig indices and padded each mesh's inverse-bindpose
//! table to rig size. That is the reason assembling a character is "spawn the rig once, attach N
//! meshes" rather than a per-part bone mapping at runtime.
//!
//! Bevy has no submesh concept, so each Unity submesh becomes its own `Mesh` asset carrying the
//! part's full vertex buffer and only its own index range. The duplicated vertices cost ~600 KB for
//! Tagilla, which is not worth avoiding.
