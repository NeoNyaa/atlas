//! pathfind.rs — in-process routing over the baked nav grid (see `nav.rs`).
//!
//! REPLACES the old external NVIDIA-Warp GPU server (`:8091` GraphQL). Routing now runs on the CPU,
//! in-process, via `crate::nav::NavGrid` — so it works on EVERY GPU (or none), ships inside the exe,
//! and needs no Python/CUDA/server process. A `RouteRequest` (from a UI button, marker click, or the
//! Tasks panel) kicks off ONE async task on the compute pool (so a big chain never hitches the render
//! frame); the returned floor-snapped polyline is drawn with immediate-mode `Gizmos` until a new or
//! empty request replaces it.
//!
//! `PathfindServer` / `ServerCmd` / `ServerStatus` are kept for UI compatibility but no longer mean an
//! external process — `Running` now just means "the nav grid for this map is loaded" (routing ready).
