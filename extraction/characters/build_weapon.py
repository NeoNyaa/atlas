"""Assemble a weapon (or any equipment item) exactly the way the game does -> `.eftweap` pack.

THE CONTRACT, all game-derived, nothing guessed:

- Each item TEMPLATE (`packs/shared/item_templates.json`, BSG's own data) declares
  `_props.Prefab.path` — the bundle holding that item's model — and `_props.Slots[]`, each named
  `mod_muzzle`, `mod_magazine`, `mod_reciever`, ... with a Filter of allowed child items.
- Each PREFAB contains transform GameObjects with EXACTLY those slot names (verified on
  weapon_izhmash_ak74n_545x39_container: mod_muzzle / mod_gas_block / mod_handguard /
  mod_magazine / mod_pistol_grip / mod_reciever / mod_sight_rear / mod_stock / mod_charge).
- So the game builds a gun by parenting each installed mod's prefab AT the parent's node of the
  same name, recursively. This script replays that: walk the build tree, load each bundle, bake
  every renderer's mesh by its local-to-root matrix, and emit ONE merged mesh + materials.

WHICH mods are installed comes from the item catalog's own default preset (BSG's factory build),
so an AK-74N gets the receiver/stock/magazine BSG ships it with.

usage:
  build_weapon.py --preset ak74n_default          # a registered build
  build_weapon.py --item 5644bd2b4bdc2d3b4c8b4572 # bare item, default preset if any
