"""A character part bundle -> skinned meshes, bone remap, bindposes, materials, textures.

EFT assembles a character from independent part prefabs (`top_boss_tagilla`, `pants_boss_tagilla`,
`bear_body`, ...). Each part is a `SkinnedMeshRenderer` + `LODGroup` and binds only the bones it
needs -- Tagilla's top binds 48 of the rig's 79, his pants bind 12. The part's `Skin` MonoBehaviour
carries `_bonePaths`, the ordered path strings for its own bone slots, which is the join into the
canonical rig.

TWO INDEPENDENT SOURCES agree on that join and both are checked:
  * `Skin._bonePaths[i]`      -> path string  -> rig index
  * `Mesh.m_BoneNameHashes[i]` -> CRC32(path) -> rig index
They must produce the same remap. If they disagree the part is rejected; a wrong remap is the one
failure mode that produces a character that looks *almost* right, which is far worse than a crash.

Joint indices are rewritten to GLOBAL rig indices here, and each mesh gets a rig-sized inverse
bindpose table (79 entries, identity where the mesh does not bind that bone). Cost is ~5 KB per
mesh; the payoff is that every part of every character shares one joint entity list in the viewer,
so assembling a character is "spawn the rig once, attach N meshes".
